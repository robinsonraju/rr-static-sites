    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Parchment -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application with a fixed top navigation bar allowing users to switch between four distinct, thematic sections: "Reign of Cambyses," "Rise of Darius," "Key Figures," and "The Persian Empire." This non-linear, thematic structure is chosen over a chronological text dump to make the complex narrative more digestible and engaging. Users can explore topics of interest in any order. Key interactions include a clickable timeline for Cambyses, an interactive module for the constitutional debate, a filterable gallery for key figures, and a data visualization chart for the empire's tributes. This design prioritizes user-driven exploration and understanding of the core power shifts, characters, and organizational structure detailed in the report. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Reign of Cambyses: Goal: Show change over time. Method: Interactive timeline with cards (HTML/CSS/JS). Interaction: Clicking a card reveals details. Justification: Organizes a chaotic reign into key, explorable events. Library: Vanilla JS.
        - Rise of Darius: Goal: Explain a complex event. Method: Interactive "Constitutional Debate" component (HTML/CSS/JS). Interaction: Buttons reveal the arguments for Monarchy, Oligarchy, and Democracy. Justification: Turns a dense political discourse into a clear, interactive comparison of ideas. Library: Vanilla JS.
        - Key Figures: Goal: Inform/Organize. Method: A gallery of profile cards (HTML/CSS/JS). Interaction: Clicking a profile reveals a detailed biography. Justification: Provides quick access to the main actors' stories, separating them from the main narrative for clarity. Library: Vanilla JS.
        - The Persian Empire: Goal: Compare/Inform. Method: Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction: Tooltips on hover show precise tribute data. Justification: Translates a long list of numerical data into an instantly understandable visual comparison of provincial wealth, which is far more effective than text alone. Library: Chart.js.

                madness, the usurpation by the Magi, and the dramatic rise of Darius I. This section of Herodotus' work
                chronicles a tumultuous period of transition for the Achaemenid Empire, filled with conquest,
                conspiracy, and divine retribution. Select a topic above to begin your journey.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800">The Reign of Cambyses</h2>
                <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600 max-w-3xl mx-auto">From the conquest of Egypt to a descent into
                    madness, the reign of Cyrus's son was short, brutal, and transformative. This section details the
                    key campaigns and the impious acts that Herodotus claims led to his downfall.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Fueled by a deceptive marriage proposal and guided by the traitor Phanes,
                        Cambyses successfully crosses the desert to defeat the Egyptians at Pelusium. He captures
                        Memphis and subjects the Pharaoh Psammenitus to a cruel psychological test before ultimately
                        executing him. His campaign concludes with the ultimate impiety: the scourging and burning of
                        the embalmed corpse of the former Pharaoh Amasis.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Failed Expeditions</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Cambyses' ambition overreached his planning. An expedition against Carthage
                        was canceled when his Phoenician fleet refused to attack their kin. His march against the
                        long-lived Ethiopians ended in disaster, with his army resorting to cannibalism due to lack of
                        supplies. Finally, a force of 50,000 men sent to conquer the Siwa Oasis vanished without a
                        trace, allegedly swallowed by a massive sandstorm.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Descent into Madness</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Herodotus attributes Cambyses' madness to his sacrilege against the sacred
                        Apis bull, which he fatally stabbed in a fit of rage. This act allegedly unleashed a series of
                        atrocities: the secret murder of his brother Smerdis, the killing of his sister-wife, and wanton
                        cruelty against his closest advisors, cementing his reputation as a paranoid and impious tyrant.

                <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600 max-w-3xl mx-auto">While Cambyses was dying, a conspiracy unfolded
                    that placed an imposter on the Persian throne. This section explores the uncovering of the fraud,
                    the famous constitutional debate among the conspirators, and the clever ploy that secured the crown
                    for Darius.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">With Cambyses away, two Magi brothers conspire to seize power. One,
                        who bears a striking resemblance to Cambyses' murdered brother Smerdis, is placed on the throne.
                        The fraud is eventually uncovered by the nobleman Otanes, whose daughter confirms the new king
                        is an imposter by discovering he has no ears—they had been cut off for a past crime. Otanes
                        gathers six other nobles, including Darius, to overthrow the false king.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 mt-6">The King is Chosen</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">The seven conspirators agree that the next king will be the one whose horse
                        neighs first at sunrise. Darius's clever groom, Œbares, ensures his master's victory by leading
                        Darius's stallion to a mare the night before. At the appointed time, the horse neighs, a clap of
                        thunder seals the omen, and Darius is acclaimed as the new King of Persia.</p>
