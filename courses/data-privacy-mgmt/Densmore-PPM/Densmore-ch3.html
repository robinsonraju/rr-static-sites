    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as a thematic dashboard, not a linear document. This structure was chosen because the target audience (privacy professionals, students) benefits from non-linear exploration and direct comparison. The key components are a sticky navigation for quick access, an interactive "Global Regulations Explorer" to dynamically switch between laws, and a "Key Comparisons" dashboard with a chart to visualize penalties. This approach transforms passive reading into an active, user-driven experience, making the complex information more digestible and memorable than a simple scrollable page. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Core Privacy Principles -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Styled Cards (HTML/Tailwind) -> Interaction: Hover -> Justification: Breaks up text for better scannability than a list.
        - Report Info: Details of GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, PIPL -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Tabbed Content Display -> Interaction: Click buttons to switch content (JS) -> Justification: Allows for direct, side-by-side comparison without scrolling, which is a primary user task.
        - Report Info: Financial Penalties -> Goal: Compare/Impact -> Viz: Bulleted List (HTML/JS) -> Interaction: N/A -> Justification: Presents a direct list of penalties for quick reference, rather than a visual comparison.
        - Report Info: Organizational/Resource topics -> Goal: Organize -> Viz: Accordion UI (HTML/Tailwind/JS) -> Interaction: Click to expand/collapse -> Justification: Prevents a wall of text at the end of the page, keeping the layout clean and user-focused.

                world are built upon a common set of foundational principles. These principles guide how organizations
                should responsibly handle personal data throughout its lifecycle. Below are some of the most common
                concepts you will encounter in global privacy legislation.</p>
