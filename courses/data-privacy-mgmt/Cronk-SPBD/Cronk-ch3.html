    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application uses a thematic, single-page dashboard structure. A top navigation bar allows users to filter between the four main categories of privacy harms (Processing, Dissemination, Collection, Invasion). This is more user-friendly than a linear document, allowing users to focus on specific areas of interest. Clicking on a harm reveals a modal with detailed descriptions and examples, providing layered information on demand. This interactive, non-linear approach reduces cognitive load and encourages exploration. A dedicated section for "Dark Patterns" and a summary chart provide further context and a high-level overview, making the complex taxonomy more digestible and engaging for the user. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The primary structure uses a filterable grid of cards (HTML/Tailwind/JS) to organize the harms, which is ideal for categorization. Goal: Organize/Explore. Interaction: Click to filter, click to view details in a modal. Justification: This method breaks down dense information into manageable chunks. For a quantitative overview, a bar chart (Chart.js/Canvas) shows the number of sub-harms per category. Goal: Inform/Compare. Interaction: Hover for tooltips. Justification: Provides a quick visual summary of the taxonomy's structure. Dark Patterns are presented in a static card grid. Goal: Inform. Justification: This gives the topic dedicated space without needing complex interaction. NO SVG/Mermaid used. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                        by Professor Daniel Solove. This framework helps to systematically identify and understand
                        different types of privacy violations, moving beyond abstract concepts to concrete examples. Use
                        the filters below to explore each category and click on any harm to learn more about its
                        definition and real-world implications.</p>

                        and Processing cover the most sub-types, highlighting the complexity of managing and sharing

                    <p class="text-gray-700">A key aspect of "Invasion" harms is interfering with an individual's
                        decisions. "Dark Patterns" are user interface designs that trick or manipulate users into making
                        choices they might not otherwise make, especially regarding their privacy. These patterns
                        exploit cognitive biases to benefit the service provider at the user's expense.</p>
